        <h2>This Month's Featured Destination: The White House</h2>
        <p>Ask anyone who has taken a tour of the White House and they will likely tell you that it was one of the most memorable tours they have been on. There is so much to see: the architecture, the gardens, the decorations, and the art!</p>

        <p>Recognizing that not everyone can afford a trip to our nation's capital, a team from Google recently created a virtual tour of the White House and included high resolution images of the artwork. Listen to some of the members who worked on the project:</p>
	   <div class="audio">
	    <audio controls preload="metadata">
	       <source src="whitehouse.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
		    <p>Your browser does not support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="viper.mp3"> link to the audio</a>instead.</p>
	    
	    <a href="whitehouse.mp3">Link to the Audio</a>
		    </audio>
	    </div>
        <p>And here is a video of Michelle Obama describing the virtual tour:</p>
          <div class="video">
	   <video controls width="400" height="400" poster="firstlady.jpg" preload="metadata">
  	     <source src="whitehouse.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		   <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="whitehouse.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
		  </video>
	    </div>
        <p>Although this is a great resource to virtually explore the White House, there's still nothing quite like being there in person. By visiting our nation's capital, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of our nation and its fascinating history. Be sure to check out our monthly special page, where trips to Washington DC begin at <s>$799</s> $699.</p>
